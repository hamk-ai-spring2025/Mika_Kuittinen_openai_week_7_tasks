Assignment #14: News search &amp; summary and 15 Product info scraper and enhancer

## ASSIGNMENTS 14: Generate web app to search and summarize the latest news. User gives the search term or category of the news and time period e.g. today, last week, last month or last year (limiting the searches to that time period). The news could be gathered from Google News or X/Twitter. The program should display the summary of news. I recommend to use langchain and Google Serper Api or Tavily API or Grok API. You can use whatever LLM you want to summarize the news.
